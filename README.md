Carpo is a Jupyter-lab extension that supports in-class coding. It's designed to facilitate active learning in Data Science and Machine Learning courses.

To use carpo, instructors, teaching assistants and students must first install JupyterLab (version 3.0 or later) on their computers.


## For students
Students can use the CodingHub without having to install the JupyterLab extension on their computers.  See [COMP4151](CodingHub/COMP4151.md), for example, on how to login to the CodingHub.

Alternately, students can install the extension on the own computer.
