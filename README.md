### Requirements to run carpo JupyterLab Extensions

* JupyterLab >= 3.0

Both instructor and student should have JupyterLab installed into their machines.


## For students
Students can use the CodingHub without having to install the JupyterLab extension on their computers.  See [COMP4151](CodingHub/COMP4151.md), for example, on how to login to the CodingHub.

Alternately, students can install the extension on the own computer.
