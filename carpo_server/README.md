carpo_server handles communications between teachers/TAs and students.

The server should be installed on a dedicated server, e.g. a Linux box.

The server code is written in Go. It is essentially a web app.  It doesn't need an external web server for this usage.

There are two ways to get the server code to run on a server:
1. Getting the preecompiled binary code.
2. Compiling the source code on the server to generate the binary.

## Precompiled server code

* Windows: tba
* MacOS: tba

## Compiling the source code
